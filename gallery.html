                    No wonder avocado toast is everywhere: It’s a great source of fiber and contains a host of good for-you vitamins, and the crisp/creamy texture satisfies every time. Plus it makes for a darn good Instagram picture if you are into that kind of thing.

                    These four-ingredient meatballs are genius. 
                    By adding reduced-fat pesto sauce to the ground turkey meat, you streamline the meatball prep. 
                    With one easy ingredient, you get basil, garlic, cheese, and oil. 
                    And in addition to great flavor, the pesto makes the meatballs wonderfully juicy, too. 
                    All that's left to add is breadcrumbs, egg whites, and a little salt. 
                    You can serve these with spaghetti, or even spaghetti squash.

                            Chicken tortilla soup is a great Winter or Summer soup and goes great with some fresh herbs and lime.
                            If you are vegetarian, feel free to cook without the chicken, replace the chicken broth with veggie broth,
                            and just have tortilla soup.

                        Satisfying and so simple to make, this soup is packed with fiber and protein to sustain you. For added heat, stir a little chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce into the lime cream. Black beans are a classic here, but there is no reason you can't substitute kidney, navy, or pinto beans. If you wish to use dried beans, see Notes below. Serve this soup with a simple green salad or as a delicious

                        These Special K Bars are a Tufte family tradition. Although I would love to avoid 
                        cliche, these are Grandma's recipe. They are gooey, delicous, and melt in your mouth.
                        If you are on a diet, I would avoid these because it is impossible to only eat one.

                        Go ahead and grab a couple of these bite-size cookies. They might be little, but they pack a big chocolate punch. We’ve used dark brown sugar in these cookies, which contains more molasses than light brown sugar. It adds a rich, complex flavor to these cookies and helps make them moister and chewier. But if you have only got light brown sugar in your pantry, that will work just fine. Swap out the chocolate chips for any morsels you like—cinnamon chips, butterscotch, toffee, or white chocolate chips. Or stir in some chopped nuts, if you’d like a little crunch.
