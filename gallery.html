                    No wonder avocado toast is everywhere: It’s a great source of fiber and contains a host of good for-you vitamins, and the crisp/creamy texture satisfies every time.
                    Plus it makes for a darn good Instagram picture if you are into that kind of thing. When making this dish, however, it is important to remember that the avocados make the dish.
                    So, it will be worth your while to find the best avocado that is perfectly ripe because otherwise, if I'm being honest, you are just selling yourself short.

                    These four-ingredient meatballs are genius.
                    By adding reduced-fat pesto sauce to the ground turkey meat, you streamline the meatball prep.
                    With one easy ingredient, you get basil, garlic, cheese, and oil.
                    And in addition to great flavor, the pesto makes the meatballs wonderfully juicy, too.
                    All that's left to add is breadcrumbs, egg whites, and a little salt.
                    You can serve these with spaghetti, or even spaghetti squash.

                    This easy recipe is courtesy of weightwatchers.com and can make a great meal, side, or snack.
                    Chicken tortilla soup is a great Winter or Summer soup and goes great with some fresh herbs and lime.
                    If you are vegetarian, feel free to cook without the chicken, replace the chicken broth with veggie broth,
                    and just have tortilla soup. Tortilla soup is a personal favorite of mine, and you will not come across a recipe better than this one.
                    The crunch of the chips is the perfect contrast with a nice spicy soup.

For added heat, stir a little chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce into the lime cream. Black beans are a classic here, but there is no reason you can't substitute kidney, navy, or pinto beans. If you wish to use dried beans, see Notes below.

                    Holy cow this is good. You thought you'd seen it all with Chili, but now you know that real Chili just likes to play hard to get.
                    If you haven't had the pleasure of discovering what exactly the original designer of Chili most likely had in mind, then please,
                    broaden your horizons here. Furthermore, this chili is heathly and hearty. Most chilis will sit in your gut for hours and even days, but this chili is easy on the eyes and light on the gut.
                    So, next time your looking for a winter dish that won't leave you stuffed for hours choose this chili.

                    These Special K Bars are a Tufte family tradition. Although I would love to avoid
                    cliche, these are Grandma's recipe. They are gooey, delicous, and melt in your mouth.
                    If you are on a diet, I would avoid these because it is impossible to only eat one. I have wathced my entire
                    extended family devour these in minutes. My uncle devours these things in seconds, and my Grandma is famed for them.

                    Go ahead and grab a couple of these bite-size cookies. They might be little, but they pack a big chocolate punch. We’ve used dark brown sugar in these cookies, which contains more molasses than light brown sugar. It adds a rich, complex flavor to these cookies and helps make them moister and chewier. But if you have only got light brown sugar in your pantry, that will work just fine. Swap out the chocolate chips for any morsels you like—cinnamon chips, butterscotch, toffee, or white chocolate chips. Or stir in some chopped nuts, if you’d like a little crunch.
