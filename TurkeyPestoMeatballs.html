            <p>These four-ingredient meatballs are genius. By adding reduced-fat pesto sauce to the ground turkey meat, you streamline the meatball prep. With one easy ingredient, you get basil, garlic, cheese, and oil. And in addition to great flavor, the pesto makes the meatballs wonderfully juicy, too. All that's left to add is breadcrumbs, egg whites, and a little salt. The meatballs roll up easily, and brown in the oven in just 20 minutes. If you want to serve them with sauce, put a pot of marinara on the stovetop to simmer while the meatballs are cooking. After they come out of the oven, lower them into the sauce and let the flavors simmer together for a few minutes before serving. You can serve these with spaghetti, or even spaghetti squash.</p>
