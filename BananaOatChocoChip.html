            Awh man, its happened again. You're fixing for some sweets but, gosh darn it, you know you shouldn't. You can imagine your doctor's sympathetic yet scathing tone-"they're just not healthy!"

            Bake 'em up and pack em' down, no need to fear these natural sugars and delicious nuts working in perfect harmony to provide you safe-harbor from the nasty chemicals and sweeteners you can

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 180* C (350* F) Fan.</li>
                    <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, add the banana and mash with a spoon until it is pureed.</li>
                    <li>Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, sunflower oil and vanilla extract. Whisk until completely combined.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour, oats, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, chocolate chips and ground coconut.</li>
                    <li>Mix with your hands until all of the ingredients are completely combined. The mixture should be quite thick.</li>
                    <li>Shape into round cookies that are 30 g each.</li>
                    <li>Place them in the pan, one next to the other but not so close together. Make sure to leave some space between them.</li>
                    <li>Wet your hands and gently press down on the cookies to make them flat. Some pieces of chocolate may stick out of the cookies so gently push them back in.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until golden.</li>
                    <li>When ready, remove from oven and allow them to cool in the pan for 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a wire rack and let them cool completely.</li>
